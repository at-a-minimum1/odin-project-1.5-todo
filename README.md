# odin-project-1.5-todo
This is my second attempt at the Odin Project Todo application. The previous attempt was first a failed attempt because I was using custom elements for my card components and then a failed attempt since I was using maps to store the values. This version will use a simple array and local storage will be implemented earlier in the dev process.
